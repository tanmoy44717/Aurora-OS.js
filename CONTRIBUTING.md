# Contributing to Aurora OS.js 🚀

Welcome, and thank you for considering a contribution to **Aurora OS.js**.

Aurora OS.js is an experimental, browser-native operating system built with modern web technologies. It explores modular UX, simulated systems, and game-like interaction – somewhere between an OS, a sandbox, and a narrative interface.

This document explains how to contribute, what to expect, and how your work will be treated throughout the lifetime of the project.
