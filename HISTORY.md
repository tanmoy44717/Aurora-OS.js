- **Grid Fluency**: Improved Desktop grid logic for smoother icon snapping and collision handling.
- **Smart User Provisioning**: New users (and Guest) now start with clean, empty home directories, while the default user retains sample content.

### System Stability & Core

- **App Store**: Fixed permission issues when launching newly installed apps via Terminal.
- **Music App**: Fixed infinite scanning loops and improved directory targeting (`~/Music` or `~/`).
- **Login Screen**: Polished user avatars to eliminate visual artifacts and improved UI consistency.
- **Modern Standards**: Improved default support for ES2022 across the development environment.

## v0.7.7

### Security & Architecture Hardening

- **Code Security**: Fixed CodeQL alerts (Regex Injection, XSS) and sanitized filesystem operations.
- **Modern Core**: Upgraded to **ESNext / Node 25** standards with fully strict TypeScript configuration.

### Window Management

- **Maximize**: Fixed a bug where maximizing a window would not cover the entire screen.

### Modular Menu System

- **Per-App Menu Configurations**: Fully modularized the menu bar architecture. Applications now define their own specific menus (File, Edit, View, etc.) and actions, replaced the monolithic hardcoded system with a flexible `AppMenuConfig` registry.
- **Dynamic Action Dispatching**: Menu items now dispatch standardized `app-menu-action` events, allowing individual apps to handle commands like "Save", "Rotate", or "Play" without tightly coupling to the system shell.

### Polished Empty States

- **Enhanced Placeholder UI**: Replaced generic "Coming Soon" text with polished `EmptyState` components featuring app-specific iconography and descriptive messaging.
- **Coverage**: Applied to placeholder apps (Mail, Calendar, Videos) and "Work in Progress" sections within Settings (Network, Security, Storage) and DevCenter.

#### Documentation

- **Roadmap**: Added a new `ROADMAP.md` file that outlines the project's roadmap and future plans.

## v0.7.5

### App Store Infrastructure & Binary Simulation

- **Virtual Binary System**: Apps are now treated as "installed binaries" located in `/usr/bin` (e.g., `/usr/bin/music`, `/usr/bin/notepad`).
- **Launch Guards**: The OS and Finder now verify the existence of the app binary before attempting to launch it, simulating a real file system dependency.
- **App Store Foundation**: Laid the groundwork for a future App Store by decoupling app logic from system availability—apps can now be "uninstalled" (binary removed) or "installed" dynamically.

### Music App Restoration & Fixes

- **Restored "Real-Life" App Behavior**: Music playback is now strictly gated by the application window. Double-clicking a file opens the app, which then initiates playback. This prevents "headless" background audio and resolves infinite restart loops.
- **Context Switching Fixed**: Resolved an issue where switching between songs with the same index (e.g., in different playlists) would fail to update the audio. The engine now uses unique Song IDs for reliable tracking.

### Notepad & Shell Integration

- **Shell Script Support**: Added native support for `.sh` files.
- **Bash Syntax Highlighting**: Integrated `prism-bash` for accurate syntax coloring of shell scripts.
- **File Association**: `.sh` files now automatically open in Notepad from Desktop and Finder.

### System Improvements

  - **Variable Speed**: Implemented non-linear log scrolling logic to simulate realistic processing delays and network bursts.
- **System Integrity**:
  - **Secure Boot**: Integrated `integrity.ts` into the startup flow to verify the "Distributor" identity against the signed codebase.
  - **Visual Feedback**: Boot logs now strictly adhere to the "Mental OS" palette (Cyan `SECURE` / Pink `WARNING`) instead of generic rainbow colors.
  - **Identity**: Added support for a custom `"nickname"` field in `package.json` to display hacker aliases in the boot logs.

- **Project Integrity System**:
  - **Identity Validation**: Implemented strict runtime checks that verify the project's identity (`package.json`) against hardcoded cryptographic constants.
  - **Safe Mode**: Modifying the project's core identity (name, author, license) triggers a degraded "Safe Mode" (Read-Only Filesystem, disabled `sudo`).
  - **Developer Override**: Added a hidden `dev-unlock` mechanism (Stealth Mode) allowing developers to bypass integrity checks with a secure token.
  - **Insurance Policy**: Added a hidden "Credits & License" drawer (triggered by 6 rapid clicks on the Apple logo) that displays the immutable project origin.
  - **Visual Feedback**: Login screen and Credits drawer now dynamically display a "Secure System" (Green) or "System Compromised" (Red) status.
- **Licensing & Metadata**:
  - **AGPL-3.0**: Officially transitioned the project license to AGPL-3.0 to ensure open-source integrity.
  - **Metadata Enrichment**: Populated `package.json` with comprehensive metadata (contributors, keywords, engine requirements) aligned with the GitHub repository.
- **Maintenance**:
  - **Dependency Bumps**: Updated `vite`, `recharts`, `typescript-eslint`, `autoprefixer`, and `@types/node` to latest stable versions.

  - **Tooltip Rendering**: Fixed tooltips appearing behind the menu bar or off-screen.
- **Migration System**:
  - **Smart Merge Algorithm**: Implemented a non-destructive migration strategy for version updates.
  - **Persistence**: New features are added to users' filesystems while strictly preserving existing modifications, preventing "hard resets" and respecting user customization.
- **Terminal & Security**:
  - **Session Isolation**: `sudo` and `su` commands now spawn isolated sessions within the terminal tab, changing the effective user only for that specific shell context without affecting the global desktop session.
  - **Dynamic UI**: Terminal prompt and input colors now dynamically reflect the active user (Red for root, System Accent for User, Purple for others).
  - **History Persistence**: Command history is now consistently saved per-session and accurately preserved even after `clear`, behaving like ZSH.
  - **Isolation Logic**: File operations (touch, rm, etc.) strictly respect the effective terminal user's permissions, allowing true multi-user simulation (e.g., standard users cannot delete root-owned files in `/var`).

## v0.7.2-patch2

- **Terminal Implementation**:
  - **Advanced Architecture**: Implemented `su` and `sudo` for user switching and privilege escalation simulation.
  - **Output Redirection**: Added support for standard shell redirection, allowing file creation and appending (e.g., `echo "data" > file.txt`).
