A hacking game where the operating system is the game.

Aurora OS.js is an experimental, open‑source OS‑simulation / hacking game framework built entirely with modern web technologies: React, Vite, Tailwind, and Electron.  
It’s not a finished game, yet. It’s the foundation: a playable, extensible virtual operating system designed to host hacking mechanics, scripting, multiplayer systems, and emergent gameplay.

## ✨ What exists right now

Even in its current proof‑of‑concept state, Aurora OS already solves the hard problems:

- 🗂 Virtual filesystem (persistent, sandboxed)
- 🧠 App lifecycle & OS‑level user flow
- 💻 Functional bash‑like terminal
- 🧩 Modular app architecture with context-aware Menu Bar system
- 📝 Notepad app with syntax highlighting for: .txt, .md, .js, .jsx, .css, .html, .sh, and more
- 🎛 Window management & desktop UX

## 🧭 Where This Is Going

Aurora OS is developed in clear evolutionary steps:

- **Stage 0 (0.x.x) — Foundation & Usability**: Functional desktop OS with real applications and natural usability.
- **Stage 1 (1.x.x) — Single-Player Hacking Game**: Playable single-player hacking experience (Steam Early Access).
- **Stage 2 (2.x.x) — Multiplayer Hacking World**: Persistent multiplayer hacking environment (Steamworks).

### [View full roadmap](ROADMAP.md)

The long‑term vision is an OS that feels real, but behaves like a game.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

I’m deeply inspired by hacking and programming‑driven games:

- [Hackmud](https://store.steampowered.com/app/469920/hackmud/) — brilliant multiplayer scripting
- [Grey Hack](https://store.steampowered.com/app/605230/Grey_Hack/) — ambitious PvP and persistence
- [Bitburner](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src) — elegant JavaScript sandboxing
- [else Heart.break()](https://store.steampowered.com/app/400110/Else_HeartBreak/) — unmatched atmosphere and immersion

Each of them nailed something important — and each of them also felt like they stopped just short of broader reach or replayability.  
When I discovered [OS.js](https://github.com/os-js/OS.js), a thought clicked instantly:

> What if the OS itself is the game engine?

Aurora OS.js began as that experiment — inspired by OS.js and [Puter](https://github.com/HeyPuter/puter), but reshaped into a game‑first system.

## 🧪 Current Status

- Actively developed
- Architecture stabilizing
- UX polishing in progress
- Looking for **early testers, contributors, and curious minds**

This is the ideal phase to influence direction, architecture, and gameplay systems.

## Release Notes (v0.8.2)

### Added

- **Gamified Resource Monitor**: Implemented a global RAM monitoring system that simulates resource usage based on active/inactive user sessions, open windows, and background throttling.
- **Memory Applet**: Added a new applet that displays memory usage and provides a way to see memory usage in real-time.
- **Debugging Tools**: Exposed `window.aurora.checkRamUsage()` for real-time resource analysis in the console.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Complete translation support for **Battery Applet** and **Audio Applet** across 6 languages (en, es, fr, de, pt, ro).
- **Battery Metrics**: Added detailed battery health, cycle count, temperature, and voltage metrics (visible on supported hardware).
- **Browser**: Added support for multiple tabs (add, close, switch), and implemented bookmark storage, a toggleable star icon, and a bookmark bar that appears when items are saved.
- **Terminal**: Added the `history` command to show command history and clear it.
- **Support for Chinese (simplified) language**

### Improved

- **Realistic App Resources**: Recalibrated all applications with "heavy" modern resource footprints (e.g., Browser ~450MB, DevCenter ~800MB) for better simulation accuracy.
- **Desktop Detection**: Battery applet now intelligently hides sensor data on desktop environments while preserving basic status.
- **Audio Applet**: Refactored to support dynamic localization keys.
- **Browser**: Added a simulated progress bar (loads to 80% -> pauses -> finishes) for better UX.
- **Menu Bar time**: Clicking the time switches from server time to local time.
- **Support for small screens**: Improved support for 1366x768 resolution, adapting the apps spawning position and size relative to the screen size.
- **Music App and applet**: Added seek bar control.
- **Docker**: is now responsive with an "show all apps" features for over 3 apps in the first section.
- **Code Quality**: Enhanced linting rules, resolved React hook dependency warnings, and standardized storage key management in `memory.ts`.

### Fixed

- **Tooltip Alignment**: Fixed tooltip alignment for Docker (vertically centered).
- **Calendar**: Fixed date navigation alignment.
