A hacking game where the operating system is the game.

Aurora OS.js is an experimental, open‑source OS‑simulation / hacking game framework built entirely with modern web technologies: React, Vite, Tailwind, and Electron.  
It’s not a finished game, yet. It’s the foundation: a playable, extensible virtual operating system designed to host hacking mechanics, scripting, multiplayer systems, and emergent gameplay.

## ✨ What exists right now

Even in its current proof‑of‑concept state, Aurora OS already solves the hard problems:

- 🗂 **Virtual User Space**: Persistent `localStorage` filesystem with real user permissions (`rwx`), user homes, and multi-user isolation (`root`, `guest`, custom users).
- 🧠 **App Engine**: Window management, z-indexing, process lifecycle, and a global context-aware Menu Bar.
- 💻 **Terminal**: Bash-like environment with pipes, IO redirection, history, and internal commands (`ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `sudo`, `su`).
- **System Apps**:
- **Finder**: Drag & drop file management, list/grid views, and trash can.
- **App Store**: Install/uninstall apps with permission checks (`sudo` support).
- **Settings**: System configuration, user management, and personalization.
- **DevCenter**: System diagnostics and logs.
- 🎨 **Creative & Media**:
  - **Photos**: Full gallery with albums, favorites, lightbox, and reactive library scanning.
  - **Music**: Playlist management, background playback, and binary ID3 metadata parsing.
- 📝 **Productivity & Internet**:
  - **Notepad**: Monaco-like editor with syntax highlighting for 10+ languages.
  - **Browser**: Functional web browser simulation with history and tabs.
  - **Mail**: Email client simulation with attachments and multiple mailboxes.
  - **Calendar**: Event management with drag & drop support.
  - **Messages**: Chat interface simulation.
- **Localization**: Fully translated in English, German, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Romanian, Chinese, Russian, Japanese, Polish, Korean, and Turkish.

## 🧭 Where This Is Going

Aurora OS is developed in clear evolutionary steps:

- **Stage 0 (0.x.x) — Foundation & Usability**: Functional desktop OS with real applications and natural usability.
- **Stage 1 (1.x.x) — Single-Player Hacking Game**: Playable single-player hacking experience (Steam Early Access).
- **Stage 2 (2.x.x) — Multiplayer Hacking World**: Persistent multiplayer hacking environment (Steamworks).

The long‑term vision is an OS that feels real, but behaves like a game.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

I’m deeply inspired by hacking and programming‑driven games:

- [Hackmud](https://store.steampowered.com/app/469920/hackmud/) — brilliant multiplayer scripting
- [Grey Hack](https://store.steampowered.com/app/605230/Grey_Hack/) — ambitious PvP and persistence
- [Bitburner](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src) — elegant JavaScript sandboxing
- [else Heart.break()](https://store.steampowered.com/app/400110/Else_HeartBreak/) — unmatched atmosphere and immersion

Each of them nailed something important — and each of them also felt like they stopped just short of broader reach or replayability.  
When I discovered [OS.js](https://github.com/os-js/OS.js), a thought clicked instantly:

> What if the OS itself is the game engine?

Aurora OS.js began as that experiment — inspired by OS.js and [Puter](https://github.com/HeyPuter/puter), but reshaped into a game‑first system.

## 🧪 Current Status

- Actively developed
- Architecture stabilizing
- UX polishing in progress
- Looking for **early testers, contributors, and curious minds**

This is the ideal phase to influence direction, architecture, and gameplay systems.

## Release Notes (v0.8.5)

### Added

- **GPU Capabilities**: Added hardware acceleration toggle in BIOS and Settings (High Fidelity vs Performance presets).
- **Network Simulation**: with functional connection applet and password input. OS is responsive to the network state and react to the connection specifications (speed, signal, etc.): open/WEP/WPA/WPA2/WPA3 security that reflects the max. download speed of the network, signal strength that sets the percentage of the max. download speed, and more to come.
- **Localization**: Full native translations for 12 languages (EN, DE, ES, FR, PT, RO, RU, JA, PL, KO, TR, ZH).
- **Persistence**: Graphics settings (BioS) now strictly survive "New Game" resets.

### Improved

- **Window Performance**: Implemented "Safe" closing animations and optimized z-index handling to reduce layout thrashing.
- **Browser UI**: to match the OS theme and dynamic colors.
- **Browser's websites**: Improved layout and responsiveness for all the available websites.
- **Context Awareness**: Updated AI agent documentation (`context.md`) to reflect the latest architecture mechanics.
- **App Center**: Improved with network connection check and progress the install of apps based on the effective speed of the network (first 50% of the progress bar is network, second 50% is based on system performance - random for now, not yet implemented).

### Fixed

- **Translation Gaps**: Resolved missing keys and placeholders in non-English locales.
- **Settings Sync**: Fixed issues where BIOS settings weren't correctly applying to the `SystemConfig`.
